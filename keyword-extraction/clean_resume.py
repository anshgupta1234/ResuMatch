def eliminate_bad_chars (string):
    '''

    Replaces unwanted characters with a space.

    Why a space? imagine you have words seperated by a '/'. This prevents the words from being concatenated end to end.

    The '-' symbols are kept for a similar reason. Conjunction words with '-' typically have different meanings from their components.
